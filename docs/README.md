# Duet Chatbot
A ~smart~ super *duper* smart chatbot with task management capabilities, such as creating To-Do, Deadline and Event tasks. 

## How it works:
1. Deadline, todo, event commands:
- To add a deadline task, type `"deadline <task name> /by <YYYY-MM-DD>"`
- To add a todo task, type `"todo <task name>"`
- To add an event task, type `"event <task name> /from <YYYY-MM-DD> /to <YYYY-MM-DD>"`

2. List command:
- To view the list of tasks you have added, type "list"

3. Mark, unmark, and delete commands:
- To mark task as done, type "mark 1" where "1" is the index of task
- To unmark task, type "unmark 1" where "1" is the index of task
- To delete a task, type "delete 1" where "1" is the index of task
- To mark, unmark or delete more than 1 tasks at a time, type "mark 1,2,3", "unmark 1,2,3", "delete 1,2,3" where "1,2,3" refer to the indices of existing tasks

4. Find commmand:
- To find a certain task, type `"find <keyword>"`

> For all commands above, please type in lowercase. Do include a space in between command type, task index, and task name. Failure to do so will cause Duet Chatbot to be unable to recognise your command
> Do type "list" to check the tasks you have. Marking, unmarking or deleting any tasks that you do not have will cause an error
