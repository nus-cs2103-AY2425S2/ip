## Features

Bard supports a wide range of commands for managing your tasks. Below are the commands you can use:


**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands are case-sensitive and must follow the prescribed format.

* Parameters are separated by spaces and specific delimiters (e.g., /by, /from, /to).

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message with concise help information and explaining how to access the help page.

Format: `help`

### Adding Tasks : todo, deadline, event

Adds a new task to your task list.
* Todo:
    * Format: `todo TASK_DESCRIPTION`
    * Example: `todo Buy groceries`

When a day-of-week is provided, Bard automatically sets the deadline to the next occurrence of that day.
* The time is optional and defaults to 1200 if not specified.
