Olivero will attempt to save all task list data in the hard disk

Manual saving is not required.

## Some Notes
1. The special character <code>&#124;</code> is reserved and should not be used inside task descriptions
2. Task descriptions should not be blank or empty
3. 1-character space separators should be followed when typing the commands
4. For consecutive range operations (e.g. `mark -m <start>-<end>`), the `<start>` integer should be **at most** `<end>`
