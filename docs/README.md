## Adding deadlines

`deadline <description> /by <DD/MM/YYYY HHMM>`

## Adding events
To add an event task, use the following command  
`event <description> /from <start> /to <end>`  

#### Example

This will add a event task with the description "Team meeting", from Monday 2pm to Monday 4PM

#### Expected output

```  

## Searching of Task
To find a task, use the following command.  
`find <string>`

```  

## Listing down tasks
To view all your tasks, use the following command

## Marking Task
To mark a task as completed, use the following command  
`mark <task number>`  
Note: This will mark the task based on the number shown in the task list

#### Example

[D][] Finish CS2103 work (by: Feb 19 2025 1800)
```  

## Preventing duplicates
When adding a new task, the system will check if a task with the same description exists in the task list. If it exists, it will notify you with a duplicate message.

#### Example 
Suppose your task list contains the following  
`[D][] Finish CS2103 work (by: Feb 19 2025 1800)`

If the following command is submitted  
`todo Finish CS2103`  

The system will detect that a task with the same description exist and will return the following output  
`This is a duplicate!!!`
