The design for this user guide is inspired heavily by [AB-3's user guide](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html)

Most of Rocket's responses are created with the help of ChatGPT to more accurately capture his personality.

GitHub Copilot was used to generate some of the Javadocs more quickly
