## Prerequisite
Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/Judy1x4/ip/releases), and download jude.jar file in an empty folder in your local computer.

Then, open a terminal to navigate to the jar location, then run the `java -jar "JAR_FILE_NAME"` command.

## Adding tasks

* You can add three different types of tasks:


- [ ] to-do
- [ ] event
- [ ] deadline


* Each task type can be added with the formats below:

    - `to-do [description]`
    - `deadline [description] /by [date_and_time]`
    - `event [description] /from [date_and_time] /to [date_and_time]`

      where date_and_time has a format `d/M/yyyy HHmm`


* Example input:

```
to-do study 
deadline homework /by 1/10/2024 1600
event Lecture /from 29/9/2020 1600 /to 29/9/2020 1800
```

## Commands
> Refer to Detailed Explanations section below for more detailed explanation of some commands.

`list`: shows the current tasklist status.

`sort`: sorts the tasklist by earliest occurring.

`bye`: ends the chat.

`delete [index]`: removes the task with its index of current tasklist.

`mark [index]`: marks a task as done with its index of current tasklist.

`unmark [index]`: undoes marking a task as done with its index of current tasklist.

`find [keyword]`: shows all tasks with descriptions containing the keyword.


## Detailed Explanations

`sort`: The priority is such that Deadline task is determined with its deadline, Event task is determined with the beginning timing, and To-do tasks are considered the lowest priority.
