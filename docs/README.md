Bob, your friendly neighbourhood task manager, is a greenfield task management project!
He is designed to help you store and retrieve to do tasks, deadlines and events.

## Adding to do tasks

Creates a to do task. A to do task only has a task name, with no deadlines.
<br>
Format: todo TASK_NAME

Example: `todo read books`

```
Sure. I've added this task:
[ ] | T | read books
Now you have 1 task in the list.
```

## Adding deadline tasks

Creates a deadline task. A deadline task has a task name and one deadline.
<br>
Format: deadline TASK_NAME /by DUE_DATE [TIME]

Example: `deadline assignment /by 1/1/2025 10:30`

```
Sure. I've added this task:
[ ] | D | assignment | by: 01/01/2025 10:30
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

## Adding event tasks

Creates an event task. An event task has a task name, a start date and an end date.
<br>
Format: event TASK_NAME /from START_DATE [TIME] /to END_DATE [TIME]

Example: `event meeting /from 1/1/2025 20:00 /to 1/1/2025 21:00`

```
Sure. I've added this task:
[ ] | E | meeting | from: 01/01/2025 20:00 | to: 01/01/2025 21:00
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
```

## Deleting tasks

Deletes a task by its index.
<br>
Format: delete TASK_INDEX

```
Alright. I've removed this task:
[ ] | T | read books
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

## Finding tasks

<br>

<br>
If inputted due date does not have time, time will not be accounted for when getting matching tasks.
<br>
