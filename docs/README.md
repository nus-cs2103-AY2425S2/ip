### Adding tasks
Users can categorise tasks into "todo", "deadline" and "event" and add them to a list.
Users have to adhere to specific formats for each task:
- todo: None
- deadline: /by after task description
- event: /from after task description, /to after /from description

Users can specify the date/time or both.

Icarus will then reply in the format
- "I have added:"
- the task added
- number of items in the list 

Example: `todo some task`

Expected output:
```
I have added:

[T][ ] some task
You have 1 item(s) in your list
```

Example: `deadline another task /by 18:00 2025-02-28`

Expected output:
```
I have added:

[D][ ] another task (by: Feb 28 2025, 06:00 pm)
You have 1 item(s) in your list
```

Example: `event this task /from 2025-02-28 18:00 /to 19:00`

Expected output:
```
I have added:

[E][ ] this task (from: Feb 28 2025, 06:00 pm to: 07:00 pm)
You have 1 item(s) in your list
```


### Viewing tasks
Users can view tasks added.

Icarus will reply in the format
- "Here is your list:"
- the list of tasks

Example: `list`

Expected output:
```
Here is your list:

1. [T][ ] some task
2. [D][ ] another task (by: today)
```

### Marking and unmarking tasks
Users can mark/unmark a task as completed, using the index of the task they want to mark/unmark.

Icarus will then reply in the format
- "Very well, I have marked this as completed:" / "Sure, I have marked this as unfinished:"
- the task marked/unmarked

Example: `mark 1`

Expected output:
```
Very well, I have marked this as completed:

[T][X] some task
```

### Deleting tasks
Users can delete tasks from a list, using the index of the task they want to delete.

Icarus will then reply in the format
- "I have removed this item:"
- the task deleted
- number of items in the list

Example: `delete 1`

Expected output:
```
I have removed this item:

[T][ ] some task
You have 1 item(s) in your list
```

### Finding tasks
Users can find tasks that match their description of the task.

Icarus will then reply in the format
- "Here is a list of Tasks that match your query:"
- the list of tasks that match the description

Example: `find task`

Expected output:
```
Here is a list of Tasks that match your query:

1. [T][X] some task
2. [D][ ] another task (by: Feb 28 2025, 06:00 pm)
3. [E][ ] this task (from: Feb 28 2025, 06:00 pm to: 07:00 pm)
```

### Editing syntax preferences 
Users can edit the syntax preference for todo, deadline, event, mark, unmark, list, find and delete commands

Icarus will then reply in the format
- "Here is your updated syntax:"
- the list of syntax mappings

Example: `set todo t`

Expected output:
```
Here is your updated syntax:

todo: t
find: find
deadline: deadline
event: event
list: list
delete: delete
mark: mark
unmark: unmark
```

### Viewing syntax preferences
Users can view their syntax preferences.

Icarus will reply in the format
- "Here's your syntax:"
- the list of syntax mappings
- reminder to adhere to the format for adding task commands

Example: `syntax`

Expected output:
```
Here's your syntax:

todo: t
find: find
deadline: deadline
event: event
list: list
delete: delete
mark: mark
unmark: unmark

Reminder to please adhere to the following formats: 

todo ...
deadline ... /by ...
event ... /from ... /to
```

### Saying bye to Icarus
Users can say `bye` to Icarus to exit the program. Alternatively, they can close the window (rude!).
In both cases, tasks and syntax preferences will be saved.
