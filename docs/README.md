## FAQ

**Q**: Where is the data stored?<br>
**A**: Through testing, it depends on the launcher used to run the program, the data might be stored in a "temp" folder
created by the launcher itself. However, if you open the program in the terminal using `java -jar rocky.jar`, then the 
data will be stored in the same directory as the JAR file is.

<br>

**Q**: How do I find data if I'm not sure how my launcher behaves?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, the developers do not have a good answer, as this is majorly system dependent. However, we
strongly suggest **not** to modify the data manually, as wrong formats will cause the data to not be loaded correctly.
So if you were locating the data file to do so, don't.

<br>

**Q**: What happens if the file is corrupted and my data is not loaded correctly?<br>
**A**: The program will start with an empty list again.

<br>

**Q**: Will my data be saved if I don't exit the program with `bye`?<br>
**A**: The answer is **no**, However, future versions might contain such a feature.
