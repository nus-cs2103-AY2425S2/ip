## Saving and Editing your Tasks
- Him **automatically saves your tasks**, so next time you load the chatbot back and **list** your tasks, it'll pop up!
- Your tasks are stored in a file called `him.txt` under the `data` folder.
- If the `him.txt` file is missing, Him will create a new one with an empty task list.
- **Manually editing `him.txt`**:
  - You can modify `him.txt` using a text editor too!
  - Ensure that the format remains unchanged to avoid data corruption.
