# ➕ Adding Tasks
## 🎯 Todo Tasks
To add a to-do task, use the **todo** command. This is perfect for simple tasks that don't
have specific deadline.

### Command Syntax
````
todo [task description]
````

### For example:
````
todo buy groceries
````

### Expected Outcome:
````
Better feed me as I/ve added this task: [T][ ] buy groceries
````
clarawr will add the to-do task to your list, and it will be marked as not yet
completed by default.

## 🎯 Deadline Tasks
In clarawr, adding deadlines to your tasks is simple. To add a task with a deadline, use the 
**deadline** command. Make sure to specify both the description of the task and the deadline time.

### Command Syntax
````
deadline [task description] /by [YYYY-MM-DD HHmm]
````

### For example:
````
deadline cs2103 assignment /by 2025-01-01 2359
````

### Expected Outcome:
````
HEHE, I've added this task: [D][ ] cs2103 assignment by: Jan-01-2025 23:59
````
## 🎯 Event Tasks
For tasks related to specific events or appointments, use the **event** command. 
These tasks are great for things that occur at specific times.

### Command Syntax
````
event [task description] /from [YYYY-MM-DD HHmm] /to [YYYY--MM-DD HHmm]
````

### For example:
````
event team meeting /from 2025-02-02 1200 /to 2025-02-02 1400
````

### Expected Outcome:
````
RAWR! I've added this task: [E][ ] team meeting from: Feb-02-2025 12:00 to: Feb-02-2025 14:00
````
# 📄 Listing All Tasks

whether it’s a to-do, event, or deadline, along with its current status (done or undone).

# ✅ Mark as Done/Undone
To mark a task as done or undone, use the mark/unmark command followed by the index of the task

### Command Syntax

mark/unmark [index of task]
````
### For example:
````
mark 1
````

````
Wow someone's productive. I've marked this task as done: [T][X] buy groceries
````
### For example:
````
unmark 1
````
### Expected Outcome:
````
Why did you even mark it as done in the first place? I've marked this task as not done yet: [T][ ] buy groceries
````
# 🗑❌ Deleting/Removing Tasks
If you no longer need a task, you can remove it from your list using the delete command. 
Once deleted, the task cannot be recovered, so use this command carefully.
