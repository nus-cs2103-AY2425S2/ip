If you are interested in programming 🤓, here is how the above `help` command is implemented:
```bash
package joni.command;

import joni.task.TaskList;


/**
 * Displays available commands.
 */
public class HelpCommand extends Command {

    /**
     * Displays a list of available commands.
     *
     * @param tasks The TaskList instance.
     * @return The string representation of the command's response.
     */
    @Override
    public String execute(TaskList tasks) {
        return "Here are the available commands:\n"
                + " 1. list - Shows all tasks.\n"
                + " 2. todo <description> - Adds a new todo task.\n"
