# Sigmabot User Guide

<img src="Ui.png" width="300">

A brand new intuitive CLI-friendly chat empowering users to keep notes and organize tasks.

## Features
* Task management
    * Add tasks of three types: todo, deadline, and event.
    * Specify the date and time for deadlines and events.
* CLI
    * Your typing speed greatly outmatches your GUI orientation? Sigmabot got you!
    * We also prefer old school keyboard typing to modern day fancy graphics and limitless mouse clicking.
    * That's why we employed a proper command line interface for you to deploy your typing in full.
* Task storage
  * Your tasks will not only be stored in the bot itself, but also on your computer. Now you will never lose your tasks if you close the application.
  * The bot will automatically load your tasks from `data/data.json` and save them there whenever you modify your task list.
* Lookup and tagging
  * If you keep forgetting what the next thing you'd fancy doing is, you can always look up your tasks by a keyword, a date or a tag.

```
Example output:

## Finding tasks

If you have so many tasks that you're lost, Sigmabot can help you find them.
