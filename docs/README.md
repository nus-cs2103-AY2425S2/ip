# Fairy User Guide

![UI sample image of Fairy.](Ui.png)

Fairy is a personal assistant that can help you manage tasks, used in a fashion of command line interface (CLI)
which uses commands to instruct our chatbot, while still persists features of Graphical User Interface (GUI)
for better user experience.

There are 4 kinds of tasks that our chatbot can handle:

- **ToDo**: normal task with no time attributes.
- **Deadline**: task with an end time.
- **Event**: task with start time and end time.
- **Fixed Duration**: task with no specific start and end time but with specific duration.

Fairy also supports marking tasks as done, and search task by name or date.

"Fairy", the name of the chatbot, comes from an AI assistant in game *Zenless Zone Zero*.

## Features

> **NOTE**
> 
> - In command formats, `UPPER_CASE` are used to represent parameters specified by the users.\
> e.g. in `todo NAME`, `NAME` is specified by the user which can be used as `todo Send messages`.
> Space is accepted as a separator in all parameters.
> - Parameters are separated by flags which starts with a slash `/`.\
> e.g. in `deadline NAME /by TIME` two parameters `NAME` and `TIME` are separated by flag `/by`.
> - Parameters **MUST** be in the order given in formats.\
> e.g. in `event NAME /from START_TIME /by END_TIME`, you cannot reverse the order of `/from START_TIME` and
> `/to END_TIME`.
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do no take any parameters (such as `list` and `bye`) will be ignored.\
> e.g. command `list 123` will be interpreted as `list`.

> **IMPORTANT**
> 
> - All `TIME` parameters specified by user should be in format: `YYYYMMDD HHMM`.\
> e.g. `20250302 2359` means 11.59 p.m. on 2 March 2025.
>   - `YYYY` is year in 4 digits. e.g. `2025`.
