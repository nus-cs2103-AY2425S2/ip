/**
 * Handles marking tasks as done or not done in the task management system.
 * This command implementation allows toggling the completion status of a
 * specific task identified by its index in the task list.
 *
 * <p>The command operates on a task number (index) which must be within
 * the valid range of existing tasks (0 to size-1) and can set the task
 * as either completed or not completed.</p>
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * // Mark task #3 as done
 * MarkCommand markDone = new MarkCommand(2, true);
 * markDone.execute(taskList, storage);
 *
 * // Mark task #3 as not done
 * MarkCommand markNotDone = new MarkCommand(2, false);
 * markNotDone.execute(taskList, storage);
 * </pre>
