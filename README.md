# About project

This repository is a fork of the [original Duke project template](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S2/ip) for CS2103T and has been modified to be called Bibo.
This README has been updated accordingly to reflect the changes made to the project.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 17, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 17** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/Bibo.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Bibo.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see the [expected output](#expected-output).

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

`runtest.bat` and `runtest.sh` have been modified to run the tests for the project.

## Installation

1. Save the jar file to an empty folder.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt. Depending on your operating system:
   Windows: Windows + R and type `cmd` to open up the command prompt.
   Mac: Command + Space to open Spotlight and look for the terminal app.
   Linux: Ctrl + Alt + T to open the terminal.
3. Navigate to the folder where the jar file is saved with:
```bash
cd <path to folder>
```
If you are unsure of the path, type `cd` followed by a space and drag the folder containing the jar file into the terminal/command prompt.
3. Run the command java -jar bibo.jar

*Note: Double-clicking the jar file is not supported. You must run the jar file from the command line in order to interact with Bibo.*

If the installation is successful, you should see the [expected output](#expected-output).
