## Why YasuMax? 🤔
"Yasu" means peace in Japanese, and BayMax is the gentle giant (*~aww~*) we all adored in Disney's Big Hero 6 (2014).<br>
When school feels overwhelming and tasks seem endless, we yearn for a reliable companion to assist us.<br>

## Quick Demo
1. Type `help` in GUI mode for all available commands alongside their formats. A resizable pop-up window should appear:![here](images/Help.png)
   1. Take note that this pop-up window must be closed explicitly to ensure you have read through them thoroughly!
   2. `YasuMax` allows you to further customise your `help` by specifying 1 additional command to get its format!<b>
      E.g.: Running `help help` (which is distinct from `help`!) should render:![here](images/Help-help.png)
2. Try out the following sample commands in sequence:
   ```
   help help
   deadline CS2103T /by 20250224
   list
   mark 1
   event NUS Math Underground Seminar /from 20250224 /to 2025028
   todo send-off papa at Changi Terminal 2
   find_index 2
   find 2
   mark 3
   unmark 1
   list
   delete 3
   clear
   bye
3. Ensure you get the result for Step 2 as depicted in the 6 images below:
   ![sample-1](images/Sample-1.png)<b>
   ![sample-2](images/Sample-2.png)<b>
   ![sample-3](images/Sample-3.png)<b>
   ![sample-4](images/Sample-4.png)<b>

## Features
### Adding a todo task
- Format: `todo [description]`
- Notes 📝:
   - Description cannot be empty, else `YasuMax` kindly gives a `todo` custom help message akin to `help todo`.
### Adding a deadline task:
- Format: `deadline [description] /by [datetime]`
- Notes 📝:
   - Description and datetime cannot be empty, else `YasuMax` kindly gives a `deadline` custom help message
     akin to `help deadline`.
### Adding an event task:
- Format: `event [description] /from [datetime] /to [datetime]`
- Notes 📝:
   - Description and both datetime cannot be empty, else `YasuMax` kindly gives a `event` custom help message
     akin to `help event`.
   - Both datetime cannot be invalid, else `YasuMax` kindly gives a list of valid ISO8601-like datetime it recognises,
     as seen here: ![here](images/Invalid-datetime.png)
### Deleting a task by insertion index:
- Format: `delete [index]`
- Notes 📝:
   - Index must be a positive integer and not out of bound. If no tasks are stored, `YasuMax` short-circuits successfully
     independent of index's validity.
### Clearing all tasks:
- Format: `clear`
- Notes 📝:
   - Any text following this command is ignored.
### Marking a task as complete:
- Format: `mark [index]`
- Notes 📝:
   - Index must be a positive integer and not out of bound. If no tasks are stored, `YasuMax` short-circuits successfully
     independent of index's validity.
### Unmarking a task as incomplete:
- Format: `unmark [index]`
- Notes 📝:
   - Index must be a positive integer and not out of bound. If no tasks are stored, `YasuMax` short-circuits successfully
     independent of index's validity.
### Finding a task by insertion index:
- Format: `find_index [index]`
- Notes 📝:
   - Index must be a positive integer and not out of bound. If no tasks are stored, `YasuMax` short-circuits successfully
     independent of index's validity.
### Finding a task by character(s):
- Format: `find [keyword]`
- Notes 📝:
   - This command is more flexible than a pedantic search, i.e. it finds all matching char sequences no matter if they
     form a separate word in each task. This better mimics app search in real-life.
### Listing all tasks:
- Format: `list`
- Notes 📝:
   - Any text following this command is ignored.
### Viewing general help:
- Format: `help`
- Notes 📝:
   - This command defaults to getting full help message if no text follows, else it requires a single-word valid command.
### Viewing specific help:
- Format: `help [valid_command]`
- Notes 📝:
   - If text following `help` is invalid or not a single word, this command defaults back to getting full help message
     akin to standalone `help` above.
### Exiting app:
- Format: `bye`
- Notes 📝:
   - Special command to terminate bot interaction normally.<b>
   - **BEWARE** force-closure of GUI window via builtin top-right
     ❌ button won't properly save data from past sessions to cache, likely corrupting data.
